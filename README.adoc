# Connectivity Fault Management(CFM)

Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) is defined in 802.1Q section 12.14.
The primary CFM protocol shims are called Maintenance Points (MPs).
A MP can be either a MEP or a MHF. Currently only MEP is supported.

## CFM

This application is used to configure the kernel via netlink interface to implement CFM protocols and listening on CFM kernel notifications.
This is the first proposal of implementing a subset of the standard. It supports only untagged port Down-MEP and only the CCM functionallity.

## Dependencies

It depends on the following libs Linux 5.8, 'libnl', 'libev' and 'libmnl'

## Build

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j12
```

## Usage

If you want CFM notifications from kernel to print status the CFM server must be started. Using the command

```bash
cfm_server &
```

If the kernel doesnâ€™t support CFM, then the server will print an error message and will exit. It is required for the kernel to be compiled with the config CONFIG_BRIDGE_CFM.

Before configuring any MEP instance on a port it is required to create a bridge and add the port to the bridge.

```bash
ip link set dev eth0 up
ip link set dev eth1 up
ip link set dev eth2 up
ip link set dev eth3 up
ip link add name br0 type bridge
ip link set dev eth0 master br0
ip link set dev eth1 master br0
ip link set dev eth2 master br0
ip link set dev eth3 master br0
ip link set dev br0 up
```

Now that the bridge is created, it is possible to add an MEP instance to the bridge. The client will communicate with the kernel via netlink interface.

Create a MEP instance:
```bash
    cfm mep-create bridge <bridge> instance <instance> domain <domain> direction <direction>  port <port>
    bridge: br0 instance: 1 domain: port direction: down port: eth0
```

Delete a MEP instance:
```bash
    cfm mep-delete bridge <bridge> instance <instance>
    bridge: br0 instance: 1
```

Configure a MEP instance:
```bash
    cfm mep-config bridge <bridge> instance <instance> mac <mac> level <level> mepid <mepid>
    bridge: br0 instance: 1 mac: 00:00:00:00:00:11 level: 7 mepid: 10
```

Configure the CC protocol:
```bash
    cfm cc-config bridge <bridge> instance <instance> enable <enable> interval <interval> maid-name <name>
    bridge: br0 instance: 1 enable 1 interval: 1s maid-name: ABCDEFGHIJ
```

Configure adding a peer MEP:
```bash
    cfm cc-peer bridge <bridge> instance <instance> remove <remove> mepid <mepid>
    bridge: br0 instance: 1 remove 0 mepid: 8
```

Configure transmission of CCM frames:
```bash
    cfm cc-ccm-tx bridge <bridge> instance <instance> dmac <dmac> sequence <sequence> period <period>
                  iftlv <iftlv> iftlv-value <iftlv-value>
                  porttlv <porttlv> porttlv-value <porttlv-value>
    bridge: br0 instance: 1 dmac 00:00:00:00:00:22 sequence: 1 period: 10 iftlv: 1 iftlv-value: 100 porttlv: 1 porttlv-value: 200
```

Configure the RDI to insert in transmission of CCM frames:
```bash
    cfm cc-rdi bridge <bridge> instance <instance> rdi <rdi>
    bridge: br0 instance: 1 rdi 1
```

Show the CFM MEP configuration:
```bash
    cfm mep-config-show bridge <bridge>"
    bridge: br0
```

Show the CFM MEP status:
```bash
    cfm mep-status-show bridge <bridge>"
    bridge: br0
```
